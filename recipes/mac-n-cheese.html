        <h1>Creamy Baked Mac and Cheese</h1>
        <img src="mac-n-cheese.jpg" alt="Cooked Mac n Cheese">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This baked mac and cheese is a family favorite recipe, loved by both children and adults. It uses a
            combination of cheeses, layered in the dish as well as melted into a rich and creamy cheese sauce, for the
            ultimate in cheesy deliciousness! Perfect for a comforting dinner or as a holiday side dish!</p>
        <h2>Different Toppings</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m a huge fan of the cheese layer on top, since it gets nice and crispy, but we also love tossing 1 cup of panko with 2 Tbsp of melted butter and using that as a topping.  1 cup of crushed Ritz crackers with 2 Tbsp of butter work amazingly well too!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
            <li>4 cups grated medium sharp cheddar cheese divided (measured after grating)</li>
            <li>2 cups grated Gruyere cheese divided (measured after grating)</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than
                the package directs for al dente. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from
                sticking.</li>
            <li>While water is coming up to a boil, grate cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three
                piles. Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the
                topping.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look
                like very wet sand. Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so
                of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth. Slowly pour in the remaining
                milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency. It
                should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine.
                Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully. Pour half of
                the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups of grated cheeses, then top that
                with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and
                lightly golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
